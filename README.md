# Pianoforte

This project aims to produce animation from input music.

The pipeline is roughly

1. Music is input in some form (TBD)
2. Ingest input into some internal representation
3. When "played", this internal representation should produce corresponding animation

## Progress

Grace is working on developing the internal representation of music + musician interface

An is working on developing a path towards in-program animation
